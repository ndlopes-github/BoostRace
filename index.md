## Welcome to the GitHub page for "The modeling of urban races" (Work in progress)

Here we show one simulation done with the BoostRace code that is introduced in the paper.

### Settings for the simulation
The settings regarding the departure gaps and mixtures of runners are the following:

gap=180\
wave1=[2333,500,500, 0.0,3.34],\
wave2=[500,2333,500, 214 +1\*gap, 2.92],\
wave3=[500,500,2334,  440.0+2\*gap, 2.5]

All the settings and parameters in file:\
[settings.py](https://github.com/ndlopes-github/BoostRace/blob/main/python/settings.py)

and some timing reports for the runners
