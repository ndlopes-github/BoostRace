## Welcome to the GitHub page for the paper "The modeling of urban races"

Here we show some simulations done with the BoostRace code that is introduced in the paper.

### Settings for the simulation
The settings regardings the departure gaps and mixtures are the following:

gap=180\
wave1=[2333,500,500, 0.0,3.34],\
wave2=[500,2333,500, 214 +1\*gap, 2.92],\
wave3=[500,500,2334,  440.0+2\*gap, 2.5]
